EUnit addons
============

This application contains a set of addons which make it easier to work
with EUnit tests, especially tests which require some kind of
setup/cleanup before/after each test.

See the documentation for the `eunit_addons' module for more information.

The documentation is generated using the edown[1] extension which
generates documentation which is immediately readable on github.
Remove the edown lines from `rebar.config' to generate regular edoc.
